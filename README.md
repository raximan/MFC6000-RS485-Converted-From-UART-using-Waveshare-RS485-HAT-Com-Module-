# MFC6000 RS485 Communication with Raspberry Pi using Waveshare RS485 HAT

This repository contains code and resources for interfacing the MFC6000 sensor with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B through RS485 communication, utilizing the Waveshare RS485 HAT.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a convenient and straightforward solution for communicating with the MFC6000 sensor over RS485. The included class, `MFC6000_RS485`, facilitates the implementation of necessary commands outlined in the MFC6000 datasheet.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The provided class streamlines the communication process, eliminating the need for extensive adjustments when controlling the MFC6000 sensor.

- **Datasheet Commands**: The class includes definitions for all essential commands specified in the MFC6000 datasheet, simplifying the programming process.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the Waveshare RS485 HAT to your Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and establish the necessary connections with the MFC6000 sensor.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raximan/MFC6000-RS485-Converted-From-UART-using-Waveshare-RS485-HAT-Com-Module-.git
    ```

3. **Use the Provided Class**: Import the `MFC6000_RS485` class into your project and utilize the predefined commands to communicate with the sensor.

## Example Usage

```python
from MFC6000 import MFC6000

# Initialize MFC6000_RS485 object
mfc = MFC6000()

# Example: Get sensor data
RawFlow = mfc.MeasureRawFlow()
print("Raw FLow Data:", RawFlow)
```
